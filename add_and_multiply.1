.Sh BUGS              \" Document known, unremedied bugs 
The arrays holding each of the numbers being added or multiplied each only go up to 30 digits. This program has not been tested with adding numbers with more than 30 digits. Also, the output array is the same size as the input arrays, so you might run into trouble if your answer is too big to fit in it.

The program is also unable to handle decimal points correctly (It does give a result, it's just an incorrect one). Same goes with any other non-number characters entered.
